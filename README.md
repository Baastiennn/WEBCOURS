# 📚 Carnet du Dev

A personal coding knowledge base for structured learning and practice.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a comprehensive learning system for programming concepts, algorithms, and development practices. It's designed to be:
- **Simple & Flat**: Easy to navigate and maintain
- **Semantic**: Clear organization by topic and difficulty
- **Expandable**: Ready to grow with your learning journey
- **Future-proof**: Can be transformed into a blog/wiki/SSG later
