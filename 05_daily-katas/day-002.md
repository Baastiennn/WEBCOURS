## 🎯 Challenge

Given an array of integers, find the two numbers that add up to a specific target sum.

### Input
```
Array of integers and a target sum
```

### Output
```
Array containing the two numbers that sum to target
```

### Example
```
Input: [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [2, 7]
```

## 💡 Solution

### Approach
Used a hash map to store seen numbers and their indices, checking if the complement exists.

### Code
```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
    const seen = new Map();
    
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        const complement = target - nums[i];
        
        if (seen.has(complement)) {
            return [complement, nums[i]];
        }
        
        seen.set(nums[i], i);
    }
    
    return [];
}
```

### Time Complexity
O(n) - Single pass through the array

### Space Complexity
O(n) - Hash map can store up to n elements

## 🧠 Reflection

### What I Learned
- Hash maps are excellent for lookup problems
- Complement approach reduces time complexity
- JavaScript Map vs Object trade-offs

### Challenges Faced
- Initially tried nested loops (O(n²) solution)
- Realized need for more efficient approach
- Had to think about edge cases

### Alternative Solutions
- Brute force: nested loops O(n²)
- Sort first then two pointers O(n log n)
- Current hash map solution O(n)
