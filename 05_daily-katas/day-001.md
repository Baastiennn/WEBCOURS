## 🎯 Challenge

Write a function that takes a string and returns it reversed.

### Input
```
A string of any length
```

### Output
```
The same string with characters in reverse order
```

### Example
```
Input: "hello"
Output: "olleh"
```

## 💡 Solution

### Approach
Used the built-in array methods to convert string to array, reverse it, and join back to string.

### Code
```javascript
function reverseString(str) {
    return str.split('').reverse().join('');
}
```

### Time Complexity
O(n) - Where n is the length of the string

### Space Complexity
O(n) - New array is created during split operation

## 🧠 Reflection

### What I Learned
- JavaScript strings are immutable
- Array methods can be chained efficiently
- Multiple approaches exist for string reversal

### Challenges Faced
- Initially forgot that strings are immutable in JavaScript
- Had to remember the correct method chaining order

### Alternative Solutions
- Two-pointer approach with array conversion
- Recursive solution
- For loop building string backwards
